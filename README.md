## What is Marginly ?

Marginly is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to take up to 20x leveraged long and short positions on crypto-assets

For the initial version of Marginly we want to keep it simple and prove a concept of the protocol and its efficiency. Marginly v1 will be limited to one uniswap pool per blockchain.
The team will aim to scale the protocol across all of the blockchain networks where the Uniswap v3 protocol is currently present, so one might expect to see following network and pools appear inside the protocol relatively fast.
